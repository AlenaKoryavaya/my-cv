                For as long as I can remember, I have always liked to keep up with the times. As the
                internet evolved, more and more useful applications appeared and websites began to
                look simply amazing. And I liked to consider myself a power user.
                <br /> <br /> And because I didnâ€™t know anything about Tech, my interest increased
                every day. That interest also led me to front-end development. I started with layout
                basics HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and then moved on to React. I am also currently
                studying Redux. It's so exciting because every day you learn something new and I
                really like it. I also want to continue my education further and I think it's time
                to try myself as an trainee JavaScript developer. I will be strengthing my existing
                knowledge and gain new ones to become a real developer.
