                For as long as I can remember, I have always liked to keep up with the times. As the
                internet evolved, more and more useful applications appeared and websites began to
                look simply amazing. And I liked to consider myself a power user. And because I
                didnâ€™t know anything about Tech, my interest increased every day. That interest also
                led me to front-end development and I desided to know more about it. I started with
                the basics of layout and gradually moved to a programming language. That was an
                absolute delight for me as my work began to come to life.{" "}

                This inspiration feeling guided me further to explore useful development tools and
                libraries. Currently I am learning TypeScript and try to use it. I love the
                development process, I enjoy writing code, fixing bugs and also learning new tools.
                I'm not going to stop there, but I want to become a more experienced and competent
                developer.
